This is the server application (with an **optional** webui), if you are interested in the desktop app look at [here](https://github.com/anthonyraymond/joal-desktop).

### Which client can JOAL emulate?

## Preview

# HOW TO USE
## 1. Setting up configuration
In the folder of your choice (ie: /home/anthony/joal-conf), download the [latest tar.gz release](https://github.com/anthonyraymond/joal/releases/latest) and extract `config.json` `clients` and `torrents`, this folder will be our `joal-conf`.

It must look similar to this:<br/>
![joal-conf][joal-conf-folder]

## 2. Run with Java

```
java -jar ./jack-of-all-trades-X.X.X.jar --joal-conf="PATH_TO_CONF"
```

- `--joal-conf=PATH_TO_CONF` is a **required** argument: path to the joal-conf folder (ie: /home/anthony/joal-conf).

<br />
By default the web-ui is disabled, you can enable it with some more arguments:

- `--spring.main.web-environment=true`: to enable the web context.
- `--server.port=YOUR_PORT`: the port to be used for both HTTP and WebSocket connection.
- `--joal.ui.path.prefix="SECRET_OBFUSCATION_PATH"`: use your own complicated path here (this will be your first layer of security to keep joal secret). This is security though obscurity, but it is required in our case.  *This must contains only alphanumeric characters (no slash, backslash, or any other non-alphanum char)*
- `--joal.ui.secret-token="SECRET_TOKEN"`: use your own secret token here (this is some kind of a password, choose a complicated one).

Once joal is started head to: `http://localhost:port/SECRET_OBFUSCATION_PATH/ui/` (obviously, replace `SECRET_OBFUSCATION_PATH`) by the value you had chosen
The `joal.ui.path.prefix` might seems useless but it's actually **crucial** to set it as complex as possible to prevent people to know that joal is running on your server.

If you want to use iframe you may also pass the `joal.iframe.enabled=true` argument. If you don't known what that is just ignore it.

## 2. Run with Docker

In next command you have to replace `PATH_TO_CONF`, `PORT`, `SECRET_OBFUSCATION_PATH` and `SECRET_TOKEN` with your desired values.
```
docker run -d \
    -p PORT:PORT \
    -v PATH_TO_CONF:/data \
    --name="joal" \
    anthonyraymond/joal \
    --joal-conf="/data" \
    --spring.main.web-environment=true \
    --server.port="PORT" \
    --joal.ui.path.prefix="SECRET_OBFUSCATION_PATH" \
    --joal.ui.secret-token="SECRET_TOKEN"
```
Or the equivalent docker-compose service.
```
version: "2"
services:
  joal:
    image: anthonyraymond/joal:X.X.X
    container_name: joal
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - PATH_TO_CONF:/data
    ports:
      - PORT:PORT
    command: ["--joal-conf=/data", "--spring.main.web-environment=true", "--server.port=PORT", "--joal.ui.path.prefix=SECRET_OBFUSCATION_PATH", "--joal.ui.secret-token=SECRET_TOKEN"]
```

Replace the `X.X.X` in `anthonyraymond/joal:X.X.X` with the desired version of joal (all versions are available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/anthonyraymond/joal/tags)).


## 3. Start seeding
Just add some `.torrent` files to the `joal-conf/torrents` folder. There is no need to restart JOAL to add more torrents, add it to the folder and JOAL will be aware of after few seconds.

If WebUi is enabled you can also drag and drop torrents in the joal ui.


## Configuration file
### Application configuration
The application configuration belongs in `joal-conf/config.json`.

```
{
  "minUploadRate" : 30,
  "maxUploadRate" : 160,
  "simultaneousSeed" : 20,
  "client" : "qbittorrent-3.3.16.client",
  "keepTorrentWithZeroLeechers" : true
}
```
- `minUploadRate` : The minimum uploadRate you want to fake (in kB/s) (**required**)
- `maxUploadRate` : The maximum uploadRate you want to fake (in kB/s) (**required**)
- `simultaneousSeed` : How many torrents should be seeding at the same time (**required**)
- `client` : The name of the .client file to use in `joal-conf/clients/` (**required**)
- `keepTorrentWithZeroLeechers`: should JOAL keep torrent with no leechers or seeders. If yes, torrent with no peers will be seed at 0kB/s. If false torrents will be deleted on 0 peers reached. (**required**)



## Supported browser (for web-ui)

| ![Opera][browser-opera]             | ![yes][support-yes]     |                                                      |
| ![Opera mini][browser-opera-mini]   | ![no][support-no]       | Lack of `referrer-policy` & No support for WebSocket |
| ![Safari][browser-safari]           | ![no][support-no]       | Lack of `referrer-policy`                            |
| ![Edge][browser-edge]               | ![no][support-no]       | Lack of `referrer-policy`                            |
| ![Internet explorer][browser-ie]    | ![no][support-never]    | Not enough space to explain...                       |

Some non-supported browser might work, but they may be unsafe due to the lack of support for `referrer-policy`.
